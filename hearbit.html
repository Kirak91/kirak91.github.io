                                        <h2>Background</h2>
                                        <p> In a digital society, both algorithmic and human agents contribute to a transmission of knowledge. Humans often still have counterproductive 
                                            human biases, which hold them back from reaching the optimal solution. One example of a counterproductive human bias is risk aversion: people favor a short term 
                                            outcome over a long term outcome, which would have had a better reward. Because bots are able to produce novel solutions, they
                                            might help humans pass on better strategies in transmission chains.
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>Task</h2>
                                        <p> We conducted a large behavioral study and an agent-based
                                            simulation to test the performance of transmission chains with human and algorithmic players. In half
                                            of the chains, an algorithmic bot replaced a human participant. 
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>My resposibilities</h2>
                                        <p> In this project, I helped out with data collection, data analysis and write up of the paper. 
                                            I worked with Empirica and Prolific to conduct data of 20 groups, with 8 participants in each group.
                                             For the data analysis, I used R to model mostly  linear mixed regression models and
                                            logistic regression models.
                                            For the write-up I contributed to the Introduction, Methods and Analysis.
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>Results</h2>
                                        <p> The results were counterintuitive to our hypothesis. Introducing bots to a social learning test in transmission chains
                                            did not improve the performance of the players in the long run. While humans copied from bots, they did so at a lower rate than
                                            copying humans with the same performance. We found, that 
                                            
                                            Although we did not find the expected results this research sheds light to a 
                                            new area of investigation which is currently relatively unexplored: hybrid social learning. 
                                            
                                        </p>
