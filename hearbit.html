                                        <h2>Background</h2>
                                        <p> 
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>Task</h2>
                                        <p> The projects were conducted at Harvard University with Dr. Langer's Lab and the MIT Media Lab.
						For the two projects we tested if tangible heartrate biofeedback could (1) reduce stress by
						bringing awareness to the active control of the participants heartbeat and (2) enhance empathy in
						members of the outgroup.
						
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>My resposibilities</h2>
                                        <p> For the first project, I helped with study design and literature research. I took the lead on the second study, 
						where I helped design the study and carry out the data collection. I searched for video materials and questionnaires, trained research assistants, 
						tested participants. In this version the participants were holding the biofeedback device, which displayed the confederate's heartbeat. The 
						confederate was supposedly a member of (1) either the political ingroup or (2) the political outgroup. They observed the 
						confederate as they watched a disgusting video. We measured empathy for the confederate in a 2 x 2 design (ingroup vs. outgroup, biofeedback vs. no biofeedback)
					        .
						<br>
						
						Due to the pandemic, we couldn't finish the data collection for the second study.
						I ended up creating a second online version of the experiment. I designed an online version of the study, where the participants
						could hear a pre-recorded biofeedback of the confederate's heartrate, while they watch a video of the confederate's reactions to a disgusting video.
						
						
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>Results</h2>
                                        <p> The online version of the experiment showed that heartrate biofeedback was not able to enhance empathy in members of the political outgroup.  More research is needed to test whether tangible biofeedback is better than audible biofeedback
						in enhancing empathy in outgroup members.
