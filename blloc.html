                                        <h2>Background</h2>
                                        <p> 
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>Task</h2>
                                        <p> Technology should bend to fit the user and not the other way around. I was disappointed to see that smartphone companies
											are using their psychological expertise, to make a device that makes the user's so addicted, that they can't leave it at home, 
											and that can lead to anxiety and depression. I wanted to contribute to a smartphone design, that makes people look at their 
											friends and family during dinner and not on their displays, that makes you productive instead of distracted and mindful. For this project
											interned at a start-up in Berlin called "Blloc"
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>My resposibilities</h2>
                                        <p> In this project, I helped out with data collection, data analysis and write up of the paper. 
                                            I worked with Empirica and Prolific to conduct data of 20 groups, with 8 participants in each group.
                                             For the data analysis, I used R to model mostly  linear mixed regression models and
                                            logistic regression models.
                                            For the write-up I contributed to the Introduction, Methods and Analysis.
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>Results</h2>
                                        <p> The results were counterintuitive to our hypothesis. Introducing bots to a social learning test in transmission chains
                                            did not improve the performance of the players in the long run. While humans copied from bots, they did so at a lower rate than
                                            copying humans with the same performance. We found, that 
                                            
                                            Although we did not find the expected results this research sheds light to a 
                                            new area of investigation which is currently relatively unexplored: hybrid social learning. 
                                            
                                        </p>
