                                        <h2>Background</h2>
                                        <p> 
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>Task</h2>
                                        <p> Technology should bend to fit the user and not the other way around. I was disappointed to see that smartphone companies
											are using their psychological expertise, to make a device that make the user's so addicted. Nowadays, many people can't leave their home without 
											their smartphones and are more subsceptible for mental disorders, like depression or/and anxiety. 
											I wanted to contribute to a smartphone design, that makes people engage with their
											friends and family during dinner instead of their displays and that makes you productive instead of distracted. For this project I 
											joined a start-up in Berlin called "Blloc", that develops an alternative useer interface for android phones, called "Ratio". The company 
											also previously released their own smartphone, that focused on principles on mindfulness.
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>My resposibilities</h2>
                                        <p> When putting such a unique idea into practice, it is important to find out what the users are actually looking for.
											
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>Results</h2>
                                        <p> The results were counterintuitive to our hypothesis. Introducing bots to a social learning test in transmission chains
                                            did not improve the performance of the players in the long run. While humans copied from bots, they did so at a lower rate than
                                            copying humans with the same performance. We found, that 
                                            
                                            Although we did not find the expected results this research sheds light to a 
                                            new area of investigation which is currently relatively unexplored: hybrid social learning. 
                                            
                                        </p>
