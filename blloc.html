                                        <h2>Background</h2>
                                        <p> 
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>Task</h2>
                                        <p> Technology should bend to fit the user and not the other way around. I was disappointed to see that smartphone companies
											are using their psychological expertise, to design an interface that leads to addiction, instead of improvement. Nowadays, many people can't leave their home without 
											their smartphones and are more subsceptible for mental disorders, like depression or/and anxiety. 
											I wanted to contribute to a smartphone design, that makes people engage with their
											friends and family during dinner instead of their displays. For this project I 
											joined a start-up in Berlin called "Blloc", that develops an alternative user interface for android phones, called "Ratio". The start-up
											also previously released their own smartphone that focused on principles on mindfulness.
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>My resposibilities</h2>
                                        <p> When putting such a unique idea into practice, it is important to find out what the users are actually looking for. 
						I used my background in diagnostical methods to prepare questionnaires and interview users to find out how to 
						improve the phone's features on mindfulness. For this process I used questionning techniques, like the "wonder question" to develop a deeper understanding
						of the user's needs. Furthermore, I conducted literature search on digital mindfulness and addiction which I presented to the team.
						I was also involved in brainstorming ideas for the final product.

                                        <h2>Results</h2>
                                        <p> The phone has already many great features, like monochrome mode, a less distracting design and a unified messenger system. On top of that, we developed ideas 
						that helps the user decide when to engage with their phone and how. One of the designs called "focus modes" lets the user create different environments on their phone. For
						each environment users can control what apps are displayed on their home screens, from whom they receive messanges and when the mode should automatically be activated. 
						Another idea that we wanted to implement is called "digital journals". Digital journals allow the user to track how much they actually used an app and
						how they felt before and after using the app. Based on Dr. Langer's work on mindfulness, we wanted to make the user more aware of their 
						digital life and give them a feeling of control.
