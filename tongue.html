                                        <p> In the widely known "rubber hand illusion", a participant is asked to put their own hand under the table, out of their own sight,
						while a rubber hand is placed in front of them. Both the fake hand and the real hand are stroked in the same way at the same time,
						until the participant gets a feeling that the fake hand is their own. We explored if this pehnomenon could also work 
						when using a fake tongue instead of a fake hand.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <h2>My resposibilities</h2>
                                        <p> I tested several participants to see whether this body illusion could also account for taste. Participants were looking at a fake tongue
	,
				           while their own tongue and the fake tongue were stroked simultaneously. When participants started to feel the fake tongue as their own,
						we tested if participants could also "taste" lemons and chillis.
