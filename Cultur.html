                                        <h2>Background</h2>
                                        <p> In a digital society, both algorithmic and human agents contribute to a transmission of knowledge. In some scenarios Humans often can't reach 
											the optimal solution because of their biases. 
                                            One example of a counterproductive human bias is risk aversion: people have the tendency to avoid large losses, even if this could lead to a 
											better reward in the long run. Because bots are able to produce novel solutions, they
                                            might help humans pass on better strategies. 
											We wanted to test whether exposure to alien algorithmic solutions speeds up solution discovery and performance in transmission chains.
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>Task</h2>
                                        <p> We conducted a large behavioral study and an agent-based
                                            simulation to test the performance of transmission chains with human and algorithmic players. In half
                                            of the chains, an algorithmic bot replaced a human participant very early on in the chain.
											Participants saw the strategy of the previous participants and could learn from their strategies. 
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>My resposibilities</h2>
                                        <p> In this project, I helped out with data collection, data analysis and write up of the paper. 
                                            I worked with Empirica and Prolific to conduct data of 20 groups, with 8 participants in each group.
                                             For the data analysis, I used R to model mostly  linear mixed regression models and
                                            logistic regression models.
                                    
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>Results</h2>
                                        <p> In the experiment we learned that 
											Humans are able to imitate solutions from an algorithm with counter-intuitive biases. However, Participants showed a content bias
											against alien algorithmic solutions.
											 Introducing bots to a social learning test in transmission chains
                                            did not improve the performance of the players in the long run. While humans copied from bots, they did so at a lower rate than
                                            copying humans with the same performance.
